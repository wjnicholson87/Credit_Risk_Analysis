# Machine Learning Algorithm Assessment

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate 6 different machine learning algorithms and determine which one works best to accurately predict credit risk.
There are three types of models in this analysis.

- Resampling(Oversampling or Undersampling)
- Combination of Oversampling and Undersampling
- Ensemble Classifiers
<p></p>
The main focus will be on the difference between Resampling and Ensembling imbalanced data. Resampling models analyze available data to estimate a population parameter; by either Undersampling(removing majority data) or Oversampling(duplicating minority data). Ensembling data involves the use multiple diverse models which use many various algorithms or training sets.
<p></p>
To evaluate the results we observer the accuracy, precision and sensitivity(recall) of each model.

* Accuracy, the percentage of predictions that are correct
* Precision, positive predictive value (PPV) – number of true positives, divided by the number of all positives (true positives and false positives)
* Sensitivity, number of true positives, divided by number of all true positives and false negatives – higher score = fewer false negatives
